# NLW-Projects

This repo presents two of the projects I've worked on while being employed by The National Library of Wales (NLW).
It contains only screenshots due to the NDA I've signed, all code created during my employment is a property of NLW. 
Please note that all data in these images is only an example of values/orders/etc. and not a real representation of the
state of services within the NLW.

  Continuation and finalization of work on a database interface started by a previous intern. 
  The interface displays information about reproduction orders pulled from a MySQL database. It allows for profiled search and generates 
  PDF reports of given records. 
 
  technology used: PHP (CodeIgniter framework), JavaScript, MySQL, HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)
